The guess number game

Context:
Your company just signed a contract for a game that will make billions of dollars, and you must develop that game in Python.
The game is simple: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user needs to enter a number until it finds the good one.
You are not convinced the game will generates billions of dollars, but your CEO seems to be convinced.

Instructions:

The game asks the user to enter a number, and provide 3 different outputs based on the number provided by the user:

- The secret number is higher
Please enter a number:

- The secret number is lower
Please enter a number:

- Well done, you found the number !


Example of an execution: 
Let's say the generated number is 15.

The game prints:
Welcome to the guess number 
Please enter a number:

The user enters 25.

The game prints: 
The secret number is lower
Please enter a number: 

The user enters 2.

The script prints: 
The secret number is higher
Please enter a number:

The user enters 15

The script prints:
Well done, you found the number !

And the script ends.

Challenge : Add two more outputs:
The secret number is *slightly* more
The secret number is *slightly* less

Hint 1 : Try to find yourself how to generate a number and how to ask for input.

Hint 2 : Generate a random number between 1 and 100: 
import random
n = random.randint(0,100)
ask for input : 

Hint 3 : Ask for input:
user_number = input()

Hint 4 : The input will be a string. You need to make it a integer :)
